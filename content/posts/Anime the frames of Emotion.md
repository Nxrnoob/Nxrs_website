Okay let's talk about anime , even if anime is not ur cup of ~~tea~~ coffee , pretend it is , just like when you fake interest around your relatives.

So Anime ,  what a wonder full piece of content ever created , iam not gonna glaze the anime but imma say my view of it , so get comfortable and read it.

lets start from how i got into it and y i like it , One random day i was walking in the terrace in a breezy night surfing the web in boredom and found a app in this sort of page that i dont remember and installed it.

In the anime section and the first one was called Death note and ive heard about it before from online clips and youtubers talking about it  , so i thought lets give it a shot , clicked the first episode so see how it is , after a while i came across some [Background music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CqpM9wr8zM) which we heard all the time in memes and videos and it caught my interest , so i clicked the first episode and one episode led to another and i was hooked like a fish for it , i was soo locked-in binging it all night. 

It was chef's kiss *crème de la crème* ,  thats the first time that i watched anime and it made me ask myself  "why i didnt start watching it sooner?" , anime is the prime example to show that bunch of drawings-just 24 frames in a single second can be this artistic and make me feel so many emotions.

so why anime that iam talking about but not the reality series or movies? lets get to that then

why anime feels different ?
	So what makes anime different from the western shows and Netflix series? Its not only the cute (u are cute too , yeah iam talking about me , me who? You or Me ?)anime characters like the internet portraits , its ability of handling numerous topics like life,death,love,loss,hatred,morality, you name it , there's an anime that prolly handled it better than any blockbuster tier films.

Now that i said about my thoughts , imma give some recommendations for a newbie 
      
- Death Note -> Psychological Thriller | coz u are
      
- Golden Time -> Romantic Comedy | with no or less cringe
     
 - Darling in the Franxx -> Sci-Fi Romance | just a good one 

- Code Geass -> youll like if u liked Death Note
      
 Okay ive expressed my thoughts and my specs view of anime , i hope u like reading and learnt something about it  , so thankyou for reading it !!! 

**ありがとう ^-^**  ->Arigato->Thankyou.
