**Obsidian** can be a second brain , an extended memory or just another note taking app its all based on how **you** use it.

I started out using it as "just note taking app" , then it became my "extended memory" and now , its basically my "second brain".

### "Second Brain" huh what?

Yeah i get it - the term can sound flashy , futuristic , or something i try to hype it , but once you start using Obsidian or any digital note taking app or even the traditional pen and paper and structure it up to your likings or setup , you will understand that its a good candidate for that Title.

### Why do you need a note taking app? (in my POV)

- Because You dont forget things you care about when you write it down.
- You can offload your thoughts and process it clearly.
- You put your brain to good use (like jack harlow says "put my shrooms to good use" in the song [3D](https://open.spotify.com/track/6xGr4tVzpTX99p9Cf0hRRL?si=5e7b7f193d1444f5) , yeah he is definitely talking about the Brain and thinking) by focusing on thinking rather than remembering it.
- It has a faster search bar and our brain has one too , but the one i have is slow Af so i prefer this.

### What **Is** Obsidian ?

- Its a **Markdown-based note-taking app**.
- It saves your notes as `.md` files — readable, portable, future-proof.
- It supports **graph view**, **templates**, **hotkeys**, **image embeds**, **internal linking**, and a **community plugin** ecosystem.
- You can customize it with **themes**, CSS snippets, and useful extensions.
- It works across devices — but syncing isnt free. Obsidian Sync is a paid feature.

--- 

### Privacy - I want it i got it 

 - I didnt want my notes to live in a cloud server , so i found a perfect workaround what works flawless for me and maybe for you too , using **Syncthing** Which lets me to sync my Obsidian vault across phone and my Arch linux seamlessly.

Check out my sync setup -> [Read sync setup blog](https://nxrnoob.com/posts/obs-sync/)

--- 

### Why i like it 
 - Its now my go-to **Digital jotting tool** and one of my favourite pieces of software.
 - I use it daily whether its for Journaling , Writing thoughts , or just dumping whats in my mind that i feel like to note down.

--- 

**TL;DR:**
  If you write, think, or build — Obsidian can help you do it better.
